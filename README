How I accomplished each item:

-I used various HTML tags like <header>, <section>, <ul>, <li>, and <footer> for structuring the content.

-I also used various CSS selectors like element selectors (body, header, main-content, footer), class selectors (.main-content), and pseudo-class selectors (@media, @keyframes).

-I also applied various CSS styles such as font styling, colors, padding, and background colors.

-I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout, adjusting the padding and layout for smaller screens.

-I used the @media query for responsiveness, adjusting the layout for screens with a maximum width of 600px.

-I applied a simple animation (fadeIn) to the main-content section to create a smooth fade-in effect when the page loads. 


Insights that I have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

GitHub enables us to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage different versions of our code. It is also a way for us, developers to  to propose changes, discuss them, 
and merge the changes into the main codebase. And in using VScode, I learned that it provides intelligent code completion, suggestions, and auto-completion, enhancing developer 
productivity. And it also allows developers to customize their environment for specific languages, frameworks, or tools.
